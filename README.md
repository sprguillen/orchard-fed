# Project Overview

This is a test project Simon Guillen wrote for his Filta Job Application.

# Setup

To set up the project just run `npm install` then `npm run dev`.

# Frameworks used

This project uses **ReactJS**, which is installed via *Vite* and **TailwindCSS**, to design the app. I think it's the easiest to make a component-based app with a clean design and minimal manual CSS implementation that takes responsiveness into account.
